thotbook-AmentI Documentation
=============================

**A private, local-first LLM training-to-serving pipeline in Rust — free by
design, no API key, nothing leaves your machine.**

thotbook-AmentI turns your private documents, research notes, session
transcripts and paper indexes into a *personal language model* — fully on
your own hardware. Six focused Rust crates are wired together by a Polarway
Delta lakehouse and exposed through an OpenAI-compatible HTTP surface, so any
existing tool (opencode, Jupyter, curl) can talk to it — free, private and
open-source.

Features
--------

✨ **Private by design** — content is redacted at ingest time; a write-time
leak audit refuses any row that still contains secrets after redaction.

🚫 **No API key, no billing** — a fully self-hosted Qwen3-8B server
(`llm-serve`) speaking the OpenAI-compatible protocol, free for a reason.

🦀 **CPU-only** — quantization and LoRA keep training and inference feasible
on a regular workstation (32 GB RAM recommended).

🗄️ **Lakehouse-native** — every stage produces versioned, queryable Delta
tables (`datasets.*`) with time-travel.

🔁 **Parity everywhere** — redaction rules and tokenizer defaults stay in
lock-step between Rust, Python and the JS reference.

Quick example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from thotbook_amenti import ChatClient

    with ChatClient() as assistant:          # http://127.0.0.1:8100/v1
        if assistant.is_online():
            reply = assistant.ask("Give one line of Kähler geometry intuition.")
            print(reply.text)

Run the same model from the shell:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -m thotbook_amenti chat "Explain a fibration in one line." --max-tokens 64
